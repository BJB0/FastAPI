## 📘 FastAPI Learning Repo

This repository contains my basic learnings and practice with FastAPI.

### 🚀 What I've Learned So Far:
- Creating a FastAPI app
- Defining Pydantic models for data validation
- Implementing basic CRUD operations:
  - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` endpoints
- Working with path parameters and request bodies
- Using Swagger UI for testing APIs

This simple app manages a list of teas 🍵 using in-memory storage.
